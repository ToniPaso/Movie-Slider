                        "The Wolf of Wall Street" is a high-octane, darkly comedic portrayal of the rise and fall of
                        Jordan Belfort, a charismatic stockbroker who thrives on greed, excess, and manipulation. Set in
                        the fast-paced world of finance during the 1990s, the film follows Belfort's meteoric ascent to
                        power as he builds an empire fueled by corruption and hedonism. However, as his unchecked
                        ambition spirals out of control, he finds himself caught in a web of deceit, betrayal, and legal
                        troubles that threaten to unravel everything he's built. With its frenetic pace, sharp wit, and
                        powerhouse performances, "The Wolf of Wall Street" offers a mesmerizing glimpse into the darker
                        side of the American Dream.

                        A group of seasoned, high-tech thieves must steal a half billion dollars' worth of gold bars
                        from a commercial airliner flying from London to Zurich. Their leader is Kevin Hart’s Cyrus,
                        whom we see at the film’s start robbing a high-end art auction in Venice. This is the kind of
                        movie that gooses its globetrotting with shiny aerial shots of European destinations: Venice,
                        London, Brussels. They all kind of run together. Hart deviates from his fast-talking,
                        flabbergasted persona here, which is welcome. But in positioning him as a roguish, romantic
                        lead, “Lift” doesn’t give him anything interesting to do instead.
